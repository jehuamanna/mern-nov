I lodged a complaint about broken furniture that might have caused me an injury. The owner implied that perhaps I broke the furniture. It was a sofa bed in the front room of the suite. I was charged 120.00 for the suite. When I checked in, I was told there was wet bar. When I got in the room, there was nothing, but an empty refrigerator and cabinets, which is not the definition of a hotel wet bar. When I sat on the bed, ...view morethe frame broke. When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances.

From the relatively tranquil settings of the hotel pools you can pop through an exclusive turnstile straight into Meditterania and enjoy all the fun of what has to be the best theme park outside of Florida. The hotel is immaculately kept with the quaint look of a Mediterranean village and offers acres of outdoor space to stretch out and soak up the sun although, like most hotels it fails to provide enough shade and parasols are scarce. The rooms have recently been renovated and there's free Wi-Fi in all areas (as at July 2014). In the neighbouring theme park there's an amazing variety of rides and shows to suit everyone. The main gripe is the lack of decent food in any of the restaurants. With the exception of Rac de Mar near the entrance we experienced cold, bland and overpriced dishes at all of the restaurants in addition to poor service. At The Iron Horse Hotel and the Steak House we could not distinguish between any of the meats served. Most of it tasted like I cooked it - which isn't great! For those staying at the hotel I would suggest you take advantage of the ample breakfast and eat out at nearby Salou for half the price and twice the choice. Its just a few minutes in a taxi to the main promenade.","reviews.title":"Stomach Churning Rides & Stomach Turning Food","reviews.username":"Paul"},{"":"8747","address":"1041 Westpoint Ave","categories":"Budget Hotels,Hotels & Motels","city":"Colorado City","country":"US","latitude":"32.388258","longitude":"-100.85452","name":"Relax Inn","postalCode":"79512","province":"Cuthbert","reviews.rating":"","reviews.text":"Editorial Review by Citysearch Editors National chain features reasonably-priced king-sized rooms with microwaves, fridges, irons, cable TV and wireless Internet access.","reviews.title":"","reviews.username":"Contributor"},{"":"8748","address":"27 W 72nd St","categories":"Hotels","city":"New York","country":"US","latitude":"","longitude":"","name":"Hotel Olcott","postalCode":"10023","province":"Nyc","reviews.rating":"5.0","reviews.text":"I just called to try and book Hotel Olcott as I couldn't find any website or online info and was told this is now condominiums, and not a hotel for short term stays.

We had not been to Sicily before and this was an excellent base for exploring several parts of the island - including some beautiful sites, all the more so for being decked in spring flowers. The Greek temples at Selinunte and Segesta were especially impressive as were the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, although it was almost 3 hours drive over the mountains in the centre of the island to the latter. We also very much enjoyed the food - the seafood was excellent (even if ultimately disappointing in Porticello, where much is landed from the boats). There are several good restaurants near the hotel including La Brasiera and (more expensively) La Caseta de la Nonna. In short, we can't wait to return to Sicily and visit some other areas. The hotel very much suited our needs, and as part of a package deal (with flights and hire car) was very good value. Driving around Palermo is quite challenging and we advise full insurance cover as it is rare to see a car without scratches down the side. Top tip: make sure you have a map to the hotel from the airport or a sat nav as without this (as we discovered in a torrential rain storm) it is very hard to find your way around the outskirts of Palermo with its many one-way streets. The hotel has secure parking (at an extra cost) and rooms have air conditioning or heating.

Also the hotel is directly next door to the Villa Carlotta (a stately house and botanical gardens, well worth a visit).

The rooms were sparsely decorated, the shower leaked everywhere and the TV was the oldest, grainiest model I've seen in years. The breakfast restaurant commanded beautiful views of the lake but the food was seriously lacking in quality. The bacon was greasy and the sausages looked ominous. They had prossecco available to drink though and had a wonderful tasting coffee and hot chocolate machine. The waiters were all dressed in fine uniforms that although smart looked as though they were designed in the 40's. The whole hotel needs a kick into the modern day.
