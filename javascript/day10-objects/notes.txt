we can use {} or new Object to create an object.
type of object is an object in javascript

fastest way of checking a property -> compared it with undefined

you will not loop over an object generally but still you can loop over using for - in loop

Whenever we are trying to access a propertyof an object via a variable, we should always use [] notation and not . operator


do not use object name inside object while refering. Only use this operator.

'this' outside an object is empty.

we use method inside an object  to perform operation on properties in an object.
